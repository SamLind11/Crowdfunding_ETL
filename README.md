# Crowdfunding ETL
This project involves the creation of an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python, Pandas, and other data manipulation techniques for crowdfunding data. The goal of this project is to extract data from Excel files, transform it into structured formats, create CSV files, and prepare the data for analysis and database storage.

## Description

The file named "ETL_Mini_Project_Starter_Code_SLind_EReid.ipynb" contains the coding to structure formats, create CSV files, and prepare the data that is located in the "Resources" folder in the git. This file uses Numpy, Pandas, and JSON to accomplish the goal stated above. The project's first step is to extract crowdfunding data in the "Resources" folder. The second step is to create the category and subcategory dataframes with the data extracted. this was accomplished by dividing the "category/subcategory" column into separate categories named "category" and "subcategory". The category and subcategory columns data were replaced with corresponding IDs ex: cat1, cat2, subcat1, subcat2. These new data points were placed into a new dataframe and then placed into their respective columns. The third step of the project is to create campaign dataframes and export them into a CSV file. In this portion of the project, a campaign dataframe was created, cleaned, and managed so that the data was comprehensible and only useful data was collected. The CSV file titled "campaign.csv" was created at the very end of the creation of the campaign dataframe with the appropriate changes made.  Similarly, the contacts.xlsx file is extracted into a Dataframe, where its fields can be broken out into individual columns.  After some more data cleaning, the data is exported to contacts.csv.

The above ERD diagram was created showing the relationships between the four csv files.  This diagram was used to create a schema to create a SQL database, which is documented in the crowdfunding_db_schema.sql file.  A database was then created from these files in Postgres.
