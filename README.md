## Description

This repository contains files written to extract, transform, and load data provided in the form of two Excel files.  The main deliverable of the project is a Jupyter Notebook file which reads in data from each Excel file for processing and cleaning.  The crowdfunding.xlsx data is uploaded into a Pandas Dataframe, where cateogry and subcategory are broken out into two separate columns, then assigned category ids which are exported in the category.csv and subcategory.csv files.  Other fields of the data are converted to appropriate data types before the data is exported to the campaign.csv file.  Similarly, the contacts.xlsx file is extracted into a Dataframe, where its fields can be broken out into individual column.  After some more data cleaning, the data is exported to contacts.csv.

The above ERD diagram was created showing the relationships between the four csv files.  This diagram was used to create a schema to create a SQL database, which is documented in the crowdfunding_db_schema.sql file.  A database was then created from these files in Postgres.
